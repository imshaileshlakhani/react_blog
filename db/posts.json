  "content": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML document including plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">What does CSS do</h2><ul><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can add new looks to your old HTML documents.</li><li class=\"ql-align-justify\">You can completely change the look of your website with only a few changes in CSS code.</li></ul><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h2 class=\"ql-align-justify\">Why use CSS</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">These are the three major benefits of CSS:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">1) Solves a big problem</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border, and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">2) Saves a lot of time</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h3 class=\"ql-align-justify\">3) Provide more attributes</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p><br></p>",

  "title": "What is Lorem Ipsum?",
  "content": "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>&nbsp;is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h3>Why do we use it?</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aPLk2e2Z3g&amp;t=5808s&amp;ab_channel=LamaDev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">text, and a search</a> for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p><p><br></p><h3>Where does it come from?</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>",
